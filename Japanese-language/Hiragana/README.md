## Notes

- **Dakuten (゛)**: A mark added to certain characters to make them voiced, turning them into a "g," "z," "d," or "b" sound (e.g., か becomes が, さ becomes ざ).
- **Handakuten (゜)**: A mark used exclusively with **h** sounds to make them "p" sounds (e.g., は becomes ぱ).
- Small Hiragana characters like ゃ, ゅ, よ, etc., are used in combination with other characters to form complex sounds like "kya," "shu," and "cho."

This completes the full list of Hiragana characters, including dakuten and handakuten modifications, along with small Hiragana characters for combined sounds.
